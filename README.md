# Smart-Lottery

This is a base version and was not yet well tested. May contain bugs. Testing required.

This lottery allows players to deposit funds in contract and receive reward with chance depending on amount of deposited funds. Participants are playing versus each other , not versus a lottery.

## Examples:

Basic lottery comission is 10%. Basic bonus reward is 5%.
#### Round 1.
Alice is depositing 8 ETC.
Bob is depositing 2 ETC.

Alice will have 80% chance to win 9 ETC and Bob will have 20% chance to win 9 ETC.

Suppose Alice won and round was not a "Bonus round".
Alice will receive 9 ETC;
BOB will receive 0 ETC;
Lottery developer will immediately receive 5% of round reward (0.05 * 9 = 0.45 ETC)
Remaining ETC (0.55) will be considered `bonus reward`.

#### Round 2.

Alice is depositing 2 ETC.

Bob is depositing 8 ETC.

Alice is depositing 10 ETC.

Alice will have 60% chance to win 18 ETC and Bob will have 40% chance to win 18 ETC.
The winner will have additional 20% chance to receive 0.55 ETC as bonus reward from previous rounds.

Suppose Bob won and round was not a "Bonus round".
Alice will receive 0 ETC;
BOB will receive 18 ETC;
Lottery developer will receive 0.9 ETC;
`bonus reward` is now 0.55 + 1.1 = 1.65 ETC;

#### Round 3.
Alice is depositing 1 ETC.
Bob is depositing 1 ETC.

Alice will have 50% chance to win 1.8 ETC and Bob will have 50% chance to win 1.8 ETC.
The winner will have additional 20% chance to receive 1.65 ETC as bonus reward from previous rounds.

Suppose Alice won and round was a "Bonus round".
Alice will receive 1.8 ETC reward + 1.65 ETC `bonus reward` from previous rounds (3.45 ETC total);
BOB will receive 0 ETC;
Lottery developer will receive 0.1 ETC;
`bonus reward` is now 0 ETC;
